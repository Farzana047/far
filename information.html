    <h3 class="prev-indent-bot2">Emphasis</h3><p>
    A room where everything gets equal importance will seem either scattered or boring. You need an anchor. Architectural spaces often have points of interest such as a fireplace or a window with a beautiful view. You can choose to enhance the built in focal point by arranging furniture around it to emphasize it. In a room that lacks such a built in point of interest you can create one through groupings of furniture or using an unusual or large piece.</p>

<h3 class="p2">Proportion and Scale</h3>
<div class="wrapper prev-indent-bot2">
Proportion is the ratio between the size of one part to another, and scale is how the size of one object relates to another or to the space in which it is placed. For instance, a large overstuffed sectional in a small room will be out of scale.

Some proportional relationships are more pleasing than others. The ancient Greeks came up with the Golden Section, which sought to reduce all proportion to a simple formula: The ratio of the smaller section to the larger section should be the same as that of the larger section to the whole. This proportion is present in nature, and artists and architects have used it as well.

<h3 class="prev-indent-bot2">Tricks</h3>
<b> 1. Paint</b>
Though painting is the cheapest investment you can make, it's also the one with the most dramatic result. Go ahead and put some color on those walls for a fresh — and inexpensive — new look.

<b>2. Do It Yourself</b>
The biggest budget buster is hiring others to do things you could do. Consider what you'll save by taking on some relatively simple projects: painting, tiling, installing a new floor, sewing curtain panels or throw pillows — whatever you feel up to trying.
