                            <strong>Save With Stock Items:</strong>Custom framing, sewing, upholstering and other skilled labor can add a bundle to the bottom line. Instead, stick with stock items whenever you can: Buy off-the-shelf frames and mats, and trim non-valuable art prints to fit them. Buy standard blinds that are a bit larger than your windows and mount them outside the frames. Snap up stock cabinets and finish them with moldings for a custom look. Order that sofa in a neutral, ready-to-ship fabric and use the money you save to splurge on colorful throw pillows.

                                The family room  was intended as a multipurpose room, the center of family activity. Architectural panels faux-painted by The Valley Craftsmen concealed a doorway and grounded the seating area. Traditionally styled upholstered pieces were generously sized. A coffee table with pull-out stools served various functions, from dining to card playing.
